title: Game of Life
---
I attended my first “Global Code Retreat” hosted in Thoughtworks awesome office in the centre of Joburg.

We were challenged to build a version of “Conrad Conway’s Game of Life” in any language. You can see the results below. But even more exciting was learning how to use test driven development (for the first time, I am ashamed to say). We used ping pong style peer programming, creating failing tests and passing it over to allow your peer to fix it and come up with another failing test. I choose JavaScript for development with Jasmine for testing. It’s surprisingly easy to set up and use.

Looking forward to implementing more agile techniques at Spiraleye in the future.
